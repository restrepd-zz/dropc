## dropc programs

dropcspm_hf is the program that was used to drive the olfactometer for the head-fixed mouse experiments described in Ma et al.: doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.14.876201. This runs a go-no go task with two odorants where the animal gets a water reward for licking for the S+ odorant. In this task the animal starts the trial.

dropcspm_hf_fsds runs a go-no go task where trials are started after a random delay.

dropcspm_hf_sprew gives the mouse water for all S+ trials whenever the mouse licks (or after 1 sec)
